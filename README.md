# Awesome Books - Solo Project

> A book-list project from Microverse. The user can add a book to the list by providing a title and an author. The user can delete from the list by clicking the delete button. Under the navbar the current date is displayed, I've took the code from the previous challenge and refactored it using ES6 modules and changes the javascript syntax into ES6 syntax, and also I've used the luxon library to display the date and time below navbar.
